# cub3d

Summary: This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.

# To run the game :
``` make bonus && ./cub3D_bonus maps/map_b.cub ```
